        You wake up and sigh. Last night was intense and you gotta admit that
        going to class today isn't that appealing. Even so, you feel like
        skipping out on classes might just be worse than going to them. You
        manage to get out of the snuggle pile that you have ended up in and make
        your way down the halls to get something to eat. It is only after you
        have gotten a couple of steps into the hall that you realize that you
        are completely naked.

        You feel quite embarrassed. You manage to slink into a classroom and
        find some spare clothes left behind, something that is quite common
        since classes usually end with one or more people naked.

        With that sorted, you realise that you don't really have time for
        breakfast, having slept in quite a bit and you head out to your first
        class. Walking inside you see an incredibly curvy woman stripping she is
        clearly the teacher and she gives you a bright smile.
